#  PulseLight â€“ Cognitive Reflex & Memory Trainer

**An interactive Arduino-based medical system for cognitive rehabilitation**  
Developed to assess and improve cognitive and motor abilities such as **memory**, **reflex**, and **precision**, while monitoring **heart rate** in real time.  
This project bridges **electronics**, **web technologies**, and **healthcare**.

---

## Overview

**PulseLight** is a **connected medical rehabilitation prototype** designed to help clinicians and patients evaluate and train cognitive skills through interactive exercises.  

The system combines:
- A **physical game interface** (Arduino-based with LEDs, buttons, and pulse sensor)  
- A **Node.js backend** for communication and data handling  
- A **React web dashboard** for remote monitoring and control  

**Target Users**
- Elderly patients maintaining cognitive abilities  
- Post-stroke (AVC) rehabilitation patients  
- Medical staff and therapists supervising sessions

## Software Architecture

### Arduino Firmware

**Folder:** `/arduino_code`

The firmware is modular for clarity and scalability:

arduino_code/

â”œâ”€â”€ main/

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ PulseLight.ino # Main control logic

â”œâ”€â”€ modes/

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ memoire.ino # Memory mode

â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ reflexe.ino # Reflex mode

â”‚ â””â”€â”€ precision.ino # Precision mode



Each mode implements its own logic for timing, sequence generation, scoring, and LED feedback.

## Game Modes

| Mode | Description | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Memory** | Player reproduces a sequence of lights. | Progressive difficulty, error tracking. |
| **Reflex** | Player reacts to fast-changing LEDs. | Measures reaction time with $0.1$ s precision. |
| **Precision** | Player selects the correct color/button. | Tests accuracy and coordination. |
| **Sound** | Responds to auditory cues. | Integrates buzzer-based signals. |

## Physiological Data

The system incorporates robust monitoring and data export capabilities:

* **Heart Rate Monitoring:** $40-200$ BPM range
* **Stress Evaluation:** Based on **HRV** (Heart Rate Variability)
* **Data Export:** Stored locally for later analysis

### Example Output (Simulated)
Mode: Reflexe
Heart Rate: 78 BPM
Reaction Time: 2.83 s
Score: 120
